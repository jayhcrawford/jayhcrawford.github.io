            By adding responisiveness, aesthetic tweaks, Google's Editor Add-ons, and curiosity I turned a simple form into a portfolio piece.

          This responsive newsletter sign up page was started while I was taking the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Developer classes. My aim was to get the certifications! Hahaha. Only kidding... sort of.  
        </p>
        <p>
          While I was working on the certification, I realized that I was essentially making projects that would be excellent for a portfolio. While these projects may have been skeletal, I saw their potential. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I knew that I could make tweaks to their "tests" and end up with something that was both creative and professionally viable.
        </p>

          One of the tweaks that I saw as most essential was integrating Google's Editor Add-ons. Plugging that in was simple. I made some tweaks to the default button class.

              <p>
                We launched freeCodeCamp with a simple list of 15 resources,
                including Harvard's CS50 and Stanford's Database Class.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">V2 - 2015</h4>
              <p>We added interactive algorithm challenges.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">V3 - 2015</h4>
              <p>
                We added our own HTML+CSS challenges (before we'd been relying on
                General Assembly's Dash course for these).
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">V4 - 2016</h4>
              <p>
                We expanded the curriculum to 3 certifications, including Front
                End, Back End, and Data Visualization. They each had 10 required
                projects, but only the Front End section had its own challenges.
                For the other certs, we were still using external resources like
                Node School.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">V5 - 2017</h4>
              <p>We added the back end and data visualization challenges.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">V6 - 2018</h4>
              <p>
                We launched 6 new certifications to replace our old ones. This was
                the biggest curriculum improvement to date.
