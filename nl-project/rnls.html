          This responsive newsletter sign up page was started while I was taking the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Developer classes. My aim was to get the certifications! Hahaha. Only kidding... sort of.  
        </p>
        <p>
          While I was working on the certification, I realized that I was essentially making projects that would be excellent for a portfolio. While these projects may have been skeletal, I saw their potential.

        <p>
          I knew that I could make tweaks to their "tests" and end up with something that was both creative and professionally viable.

          One of the tweaks that I saw as most essential was integrating Google's Editor Add-ons. Plugging that in was simple. I made some tweaks to the default button class.

          <h3 class="list-title">Initial Project</h3>
          <p>The initial project had bare expectactions. I wanted to take each project to the next level. As I was completing the initial project, I was careful to make sure that both the HTML and the CSS were neat. While I have limitied web development experience, what experience I do have has informed a sense of care in regards to cleanliness of code.</p>
          <ul class="lists">
            <li>
              <h3 class="list-subtitle">Responsive Modifications</h4>
              <p>
                I added some CSS properties that prevent overflow. Whenever the intial document was squeezed as small as 320px, the input fields would overflow off of the right side of the viewport. I also found that some of the radio inputs needed tweaking to present properly across all widths. Those radios, I dropped into seperate div's.
