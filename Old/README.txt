My website is something of a pipedream, but maybe GitHub will make it possible. 

The templates and website editors that I've interacted with over the years are so complicated and cost-prohibitive that I have never been able to host a decent website for any lasting amount of time. 

I am learning about web design, and when I discovered that I could host my website thru GitHub, I knew that I had to learn more about how to do that.
