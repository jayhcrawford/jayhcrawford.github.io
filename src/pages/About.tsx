      <p>I’m a painter and engineering student based in Los Angeles. I grew up in Kentucky and earned my BFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago before moving to LA in 2017.</p>

      <p>My paintings explore the tension between image and object—where flatness meets surface, color misbehaves, and drawing techniques clash. I’m drawn to that moment when something feels just slightly off, when a painting holds its ground but refuses to settle.</p>

      <p>Alongside my art practice, my studies as an engineering student have a focus on product design, app interfaces, and data analysis. I’m interested in how systems break down and reassemble—whether in a canvas or a codebase. My work moves between those worlds, and they feed each other in unexpected ways.</p>
