        <p><h3>Growing Up</h3>I spent my childhood in Kentucky. Being a creative kid, I had to get out of Kentucky. Kansas City Art Insitute was where I landed for my freshman year of college--but during my time there, my older brother was diagnosed with terminal cancer. I returned home, and my brother's life was cut short. After my brother's passing, my studies continued at The School of The Art Insitute of Chicago, where I obtained a Bachelor's of Fine Arts in Studio Art. </p>
        <p><h3>Being Creative</h3>Creativity comes natural to humanity. A few things fascinated me as a young boy, the color green and drawing were among them. To my parent's dismay, I also enjoyed taking things apart and seeing how they worked--only later in life did I learn how to reassemble things.</p>
        <p><h3>Brief Professional Bio</h3>Since graduating from the School of The Art Insitute of Chicago in 2017, I have lived in Los Angeles, California. I have worked on 100 different film/tv/commercial productions. I've filled various roles, from set-building and truck driving to principal talent and director.</p>
